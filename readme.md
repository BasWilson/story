## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/baswilson/story.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI (or [different provider's](#ai-model-configuration) key) API key:

    ```env
    AI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```bash
    go build -o story cmd/tool/main.go
    ```

5. Run the tool:

    ```bash
    ./story
    ```

6. (Optional) Add to your shell profile:
   Add an alias and `AI_API_KEY` to your shell profile for global access:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```
    Add these lines:
    ```bash
    export AI_API_KEY=your-key
    alias story="/Path/To/Your/Executable/story"
    ```

| Variable      | Description      | Default Value               |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `AI_API_BASE` | API endpoint URL | `https://api.openai.com/v1` |
| `AI_MODEL`    | Model name       | `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`         |

### Supported Providers

| Provider | `AI_API_BASE`                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Deepseek | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` |
| OpenAI   | `https://api.openai.com/v1`   |

## Data Storage

All project data is stored in `memory.json` in the current working directory. This includes:

-   Project context
-   User stories
-   Task status
-   Next story ID

This allows easy inclusion of stories in source control.

## Requirements
