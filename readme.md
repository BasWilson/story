# story - AI-Powered Task Management for Developers

story is a CLI tool that helps developers manage their tasks by generating actionable steps from user storys using AI (OpenAI GPT-4). It maintains project context and tracks progress through user storys and tasks.

## Features

-   üß† AI-powered task generation from user storys
-   üìù Maintains project context (language, framework, role, description)
-   ‚úÖ Tracks task completion status
-   üíæ Persistent storage of project data per repository
-   üéØ Focus on the next actionable task

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baswilson/story.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
go build -o story cmd/tool/main.go
```

5. Run the tool:

```bash
./story
```

6. Recommend (but optional) add to profile

Add the `OPEN_API_KEY` to your ~/.zshrc profile for use everywhere. Add an alias to the path of the executable in your ~/.zshrc profile for use everywhere like so:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

```bash
alias story="/Path/To/Your/Executable/story"
```

After that you can just run it in any folder with persistance by using `story`
